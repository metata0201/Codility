/*Lesson2 - CyclicRotation
*Task description
*A zero - indexed array A consisting of N integers is given.Rotation of the array means that each element is shifted right by one index,
*and the last element of the array is also moved to the first place.
*
*For example, the rotation of array A = [3, 8, 9, 7, 6] is[6, 3, 8, 9, 7].The goal is to rotate array A K times; that is, each element of
*A will be shifted to the right by K indexes.
*
*Write a function : vector<int> CyclicRotation(vector<int> &A, int K);
*that, given a zero - indexed array A consisting of N integers and an integer K, returns the array A rotated K times.
*
*For example, given array A = [3, 8, 9, 7, 6] and K = 3, the function should return[9, 7, 6, 3, 8].
*Assume that :N and K are integers within the range[0..100];
*            each element of array A is an integer within the range[-1, 000..1, 000].
*In your solution, focus on correctness.The performance of your solution will not be the focus of the assessment.

/*Lesson2 - OddOccurrencesInArray
*A non - empty zero - indexed array A consisting of N integers is given.The array contains an odd number of elements, and each element
*of the array can be paired with another element that has the same value, except for one element that is left unpaired.
*
*For example, in array A such that :A[0] = 9  A[1] = 3  A[2] = 9 A[3] = 3  A[4] = 9  A[5] = 7 A[6] = 9
*the elements at indexes 0 and 2 have value 9,
*the elements at indexes 1 and 3 have value 3,
*the elements at indexes 4 and 6 have value 9,
*the element at index 5 has value 7 and is unpaired.
*Write a function :
*
*int OddOccurrencesInArray(vector<int> &A); that, given an array A consisting of N integers fulfilling the above conditions, returns
*the value of the unpaired element.
*
*For example, given array A such that : A[0] = 9  A[1] = 3  A[2] = 9 A[3] = 3  A[4] = 9  A[5] = 7 A[6] = 9
*the function should return 7, as explained in the example above.
*
*Assume that :N is an odd integer within the range[1..1, 000, 000];
*             each element of array A is an integer within the range[1..1, 000, 000, 000];
*             all but one of the values in A occur an even number of times.
*Complexity  :expected worst - case time complexity is O(N);
*             expected worst - case space complexity is O(1), beyond input storage(not counting the storage required for input arguments).
*Elements of input arrays can be modified.

/*Lesson3 - PermMissingElem
*A zero - indexed array A consisting of N different integers is given.The array contains integers in the range[1..(N + 1)], which means that
*exactly one element is missing.Your goal is to find that missing element.
*
*Write a function : int PermMissingElem(vector<int> &A);that, given a zero - indexed array A, returns the value of the missing element.
*
*For example, given array A such that :A[0] = 2,A[1] = 3,A[2] = 1,A[3] = 5,the function should return 4, as it is the missing element.
*
*Assume that :
*    N is an integer within the range[0..100, 000];
*    the elements of A are all distinct;
*    each element of array A is an integer within the range[1..(N + 1)].
*Complexity:
*    expected worst - case time complexity is O(N);
*    expected worst - case space complexity is O(1), beyond input storage(not counting the storage required for input arguments).
*Elements of input arrays can be modified.

/*Lesson3 - TapeEquilibrium
*A non - empty zero - indexed array A consisting of N integers is given.Array A represents numbers on a tape.
*Any integer P, such that 0 < P < N, splits this tape into two non - empty parts : A[0], A[1], ..., A[P - 1] and A[P], A[P + 1], ..., A[N - 1].
*
*The difference between the two parts is the value of : | (A[0] + A[1] + ... + A[P - 1]) -(A[P] + A[P + 1] + ... + A[N - 1]) |
*
*In other words, it is the absolute difference between the sum of the first part and the sum of the second part.
*For example, consider array A such that :A[0] = 3,A[1] = 1,A[2] = 2,A[3] = 4,A[4] = 3,
*We can split this tape in four places :
*P = 1, difference = | 3 - 10 | = 7
*P = 2, difference = | 4 - 9 | = 5
*P = 3, difference = | 6 - 7 | = 1
*P = 4, difference = | 10 - 3 | = 7
*Write a function : int TapeEquilibrium(vector<int> &A);
*that, given a non - empty zero - indexed array A of N integers, returns the minimal difference that can be achieved.
*
*For example, given:A[0] = 3, A[1] = 1, A[2] = 2, A[3] = 4, A[4] = 3,
*the function should return 1, as explained above.
*
*Assume that :
*    N is an integer within the range[2..100, 000];
*    each element of array A is an integer within the range[-1, 000..1, 000].
*Complexity:
*    expected worst - case time complexity is O(N);
*    expected worst - case space complexity is O(N), beyond input storage(not counting the storage required for input arguments).
*Elements of input arrays can be modified.

/*Lesson4 - MissingInteger
*Write a function :int MissingInteger(vector<int> &A);that, given a non - empty zero - indexed array A of N integers, returns the minimal positive
*integer(greater than 0) that does not occur in A.
*
*For example, given:A[0] = 1,A[1] = 3,A[2] = 6,A[3] = 4,A[4] = 1,A[5] = 2, the function should return 5.
*
*Assume that:
*    N is an integer within the range[1..100, 000];
*    each element of array A is an integer within the range[−2, 147, 483, 648..2, 147, 483, 647].
*Complexity:
*    expected worst - case time complexity is O(N);
*    expected worst - case space complexity is O(N), beyond input storage(not counting the storage required for input arguments).
